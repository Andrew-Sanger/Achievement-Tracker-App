# Personal Project - Achievement-Tracker-App

## University project 6 - Iphone Software Engineering - Dark Souls 3 Achievement Tracker App

(Swift/MacOS) The final part of the major project in the iPhone Software Engineering course. This swift based iPhone application is an achievement tracker and guide for the video game "Dark souls 3", which i was playing at the time. The project involved the creation, design, and implementation of this idea into an iPhone application that works on all apple devices, created using XCode on MacOS. It was coded using the Swift programming language.

The project implements these features:

1. **AutoLayout & Constraint Based Design**
       The app will work on all iPhones and iPads, regardless of hardware and screen resolution. All views and scenes in the app took into consideration the orientation they would be viewed in and adjusted the GUI automatically.
2. **CoreData, SQLLite and Persistant Storage.**
       It has persistent storage of data. When first run, it creates a database of all achievement and their completion status. When the status of an achieement is changed to complete, it is automatically updated in the data base, and remains so when the app is restarted.

   **To be finished**
