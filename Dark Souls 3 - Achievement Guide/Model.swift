// This class is the model class for the app, it holds all information used for the app.
// Currently this information is hard coded into classes, in future iterations of the app
// this will not be the case. All achievements in the app come in two varieties, regular
// achievements and collection achievements. Regular achievements are contained in Achievement 
// classes while collection achievements are contained CollectionAchievement classes which
// inherit all Achievement methods. CollectionAchievement classes contain an array containing
// CollectionItem objects which represent all items needed to complete the achievement.
//
// The Model class uses the Singleton design to ensure only one instance is ever made.
//
// UPDATE
// ------
// Uses the CoreDataHelper class to put all achievements into the achievemtnList array.
//
// Now works out percentages of achievements complete and sends info to the relevant
// controllers.
//
// Implements the AVAudioPlayer from the AVFoundation Cocoa framework to play sounds
// at certain times during the running of the app.
