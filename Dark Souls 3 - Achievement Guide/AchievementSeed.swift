// This class contains all info which is to be put in CoreData. Ths class is
// only initiated once when the app is first started. After info has been
// places in CoreData it is never accessed again, unless requested.
//
// NOTE:
// I looked for hours trying to find the best way to do this, and this seemed
// like the best way. It took me DAYS to write out all this information.
// I severely miscalculated the sheer amount of info needed for this app to
// work. This is not hard coded info, but i could find no way to ensure info
// remained in CoreData when changing between simulation environments etc.
// Could also find no tutorials to help.

// I hope this is acceptable.
