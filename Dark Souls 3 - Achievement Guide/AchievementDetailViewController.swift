import UIKit

// This class is the controller for the detail view shown when an achievement is
// pressed in the achievement view. It is a UIView called Achievement Detail View 
// Controller Scene.
//
// It shows all information about the currently selected achievement including its
// name, gamerscore, description, guide and an image (NYI) of the achievement image.
// It also creates a button at the bottom of the screen which changes depending on
// whether it is a regular or collection acheivement. If it is a regular achievement
// you can press this button to mark it as obtained. If it is a collection achievement
// this is not possible because you need to obtain certain items to complete the 
// achievement, so instead it shows a button you can press to be able to view the
// items needed to complete the achievement.
//
// UPDATE
// ------
// When the obtain achievement button is pressed, a short sound is played using the
// Cocoa class AVFoundation.
//
// The statistics view is now refreshed whenever an achievement is obtained. This is
// to ensure that the percentage complete counts are correct.
//
// Also the achievementImage UIImageView is updated with newly supplied image, and
// the acheivement obtained button has been replaced with an image instead of a 
// red/green box.
